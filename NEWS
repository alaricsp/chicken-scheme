  is required to built CHICKEN from sources on Windows with the Microsoft 
  tools

- the "easyffi" and "tinyclos" library units have been removed from the base
  system and are now available as separate extensions

2.41

- Bugfixes galore
- compiler: 
  * added support for the generation of "export" files through the "-emit-exports" option
  * new option `-check-imports' (csc: `-G') checks for unimported symbols and can be quite
    helpful in finding unbound variable errors (this requires all extensions ("eggs") to be
    adapted to this new feature, a process which isn't complete yet)

  installations, this requires to either move all installed extensions to the
  new location ("$prefix/lib/chicken/1") or reinstall them
- Now supports SRFI-61 (extended `cond')
- Added procedures `load-relative', `tcp-buffer-size`, `string-chomp'
- trivial implementations of `real-part', `imag-part', `angle' and `magnitude' have 
  been added to the library to allow more portable code

- SRFIs 28, 31, 62 and 69 are now officially supported
- New compiler option `-extension' simplifies static compilation of eggs
- csc: changed `-E' to `-P', `-E' is now an alias for `-extension'
- Embedding:
  * All the `entry-point' related things have been removed, as has been `define-embedded',
    calling Scheme from C is now exclusively done with callbacks
  * Integrated boilerplate embedding API into the `eval' unit
  * Added `CHICKEN_continue' API function
  * Default "stub" toplevel (`CHICKEN_default_toplevel') allows embedding without a
    separate Scheme file 
  * Different stack-levels during invocation of CHICKEN_run or callbacks could result
    in crashes - this is now detected (or can be checked manually)
- Added extension-specifier `(version ...)'
- New FFI macros `foreign-declare', `foreign-parse' and `foreign-parse/declare' replace
  the declaration-specifiers of the same name
- Hash-table resizing was ridiculously slow, and should now be much faster
- `define-foreign-record' handles recursive structures
- `require-extension' is now available by default, and so can be used with the
  plain Scheme evaluator
- Procedures now contain some basic debug information, unless a file was compiled
  with `-no-lambda-info'
- compiler: `-debug-level 2' is now the default (enables trace- and lambda-info)
- chicken-setup: 
  * handles direct downloads from arbitrary URLs
  * HTML documentation for eggs can now be included into the egg and will be installed
    in the repository (using the `documentation' info-property)
  * `chicken-setup -docindex' shows path of generated documentation index for all 
    installed eggs
- extras: 
  * SRFI-69 is now fully supported, note that THIS WILL BREAK EXISTING CODE, since
    the API is not compatible to the previous one
  * `clear-hash-table!', `get' and `put!' are gone
  * `read-file' accepts optional reader procedure and max count
  * `read-lines' accepts filename instead of port

- The `format' library unit has been removed from the base system and is noww available
  separately
- SRFI-17, on the other hand has been moved into the base system

  (non-GC'd) memory

2.0

- Many bugfixes 
- Loads of minor improvements (better error messages, more warnings, more error 
  checks, etc.)
- On systems supported by the "libffi" library, the 128-argument limit can
  be exceeded (currently to an arbitrary maximum of 1000). To take advantage
  of this, add `--with-libffi' to the configuration options when building
  chicken
- The `libsrfi-chicken' and `libstuffed-chicken' libraries have been folded
  into `libchicken', so only a single library is linked with generated
  executables, which greatly simplifies and speeds up the build process.
  It is recommended to remove any traced of `libstuffed-chicken.*' and 
  `libsrfi-chicken.*' before installing a new release. This requires also
  to reinstall all eggs (extension libraries).
- The compiler is able to inline more procedure calls
- Implicit non-multival continuations (like in `begin' or 'let') accept multiple 
  values and discard all but the first value
- finalization should actually work now and is much more efficient (unless
  used excessively)
- csi: 
  `advise' has been removed
  `-eval' implies `-batch' and `-quiet'
  added `-require-extension'
  short option names are now supported and may be collapsed, if unambigous
- New runtime options:
  -:b (enter REPL on error)
  -:B (ring bell on every major GC)
  -:fNNN (set pending finalizer maximum limit)
- New compiler options:
  -accumulate-profile
  -inline
  -inline-limit
  -emit-external-prototypes-first
- The compiler-option `-require-for-syntax' has been renamed to `-require-extension'
  and is the same as putting a `(require-extension ...)' form directly into the code
- Removed compiler- and interpreter option `-no-feature'
- New declarations:
  (lambda-lift)
  ([not] inline)
  (inline-limit LIMIT)
  (emit-external-prototypes-first)
  ([not] check-c-syntax)
- `foreign-callback-lambda[*]' has been renamed to `foreign-safe-lambda[*]' - the
  old names are still valid but deprecated
- New foreign type specifier `scheme-pointer' (the same as `pointer', which is 
  deprecated now)
- Easy FFI: 
  `___scheme_pointer' and `___byte_vector' pseudo types
  `___pointer' and `___length' markers
  `default_renaming' and `opaque' pseudo declarations
  `___inout' and `___out' argument markers work also for C++ reference types
  Recognizes `C_word' and `size_t'
- The reader supports selective case sensitive/insensitive reading using the 
  `#cs...' and `#ci...' syntax (as supported in PLT Scheme)
- `\uXXXX' and `\UXXXXXXXX' escape-sequences for string literals
- `#\UXXXXXXXX' character literal syntax
- `\v', `\a' and `\f' escape sequences and `#\delete', `#\esc', `#\alarm', `#\vtab' 
  and `#\nul' character literals
- `chicken-setup' supports proxy connections via the `-proxy' option
- library:
  (set-dynamic-load-mode! MODE)
  `(end-of-file)' has been removed (use `#!eof' instead)
- The alternative continuation API described in Marc Feeley's paper
  "A better API for first class continuations" is supported natively:
  (continuation-capture PROC)
  (continuation-graft K THUNK)
  (continuation-return K VALUE ...)
  (continuation? X)
- `foreign-primitive' and `define-extension' macros
- tinyclos:
  (instance-of? X)
  `define-method' specializes on all arguments and allows DSSSL keyword argument lists
- eval:
  (set-dispatch-read-syntax! CHAR PROC)
- extras:
  (hash-table-update! HT KEY PROC INIT)
  (hash-table-exists? HT KEY) 
  (hash-table-values HT)
  (hash-table-keys HT)
  (alist->hash-table ALIST [TEST SIZE])
  `hash-table->list' has been renamed to `hash-table->alist
  `hash-table-for-each' takes the arguments in reversed order (the old order is still
  valid but deprecated)
  Hash-tables support now user-defined hash functions
- posix:
  (file-link OLD NEW)
  (symbolic-link? FILENAME)
  (regular-file? FILENAME)
  errno/exist
  `process' and `process-execute' allow passing an environment
- regex:
  (regexp-escape STR)
- tcp:
  (tcp-listener-fileno LISTENER)
- utils:
  (port-for-each FN THUNK)
  (port-map FN THUNK)
- On Windows, the batch file `win-install.bat' can be used to install the system
  into the desired location
- Building Chicken on Windows with the free development tools from Microsoft (VCToolkit,
  Platform Core SDK) has been tested and is documented in the file `vctk-install.txt'
- The `-script-meta' option has been removed
- The srfi-25 and srfi-37 library units and the test-infrastructure facility have been 
  removed from the core system and is now separately available as an extensions (eggs)
- The syntax-case macro and module system has been removed and also available as an
  extension. This implies that all compiler- and interpreter options related to hygienic
  macros and syntax-case are gone as well.
- All strictness compiler- and interpreter options (and the `strict-reader' parameter)
  have been removed
- the `examples' directory and its contents have been removed from the distribution
