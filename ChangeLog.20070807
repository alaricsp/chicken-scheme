  * chicken-setup non-windows file permissions
  chicken-setup on non-windows systems must ensure that files and
  directories it copies are usable by all.  If chicken-setup is run in
  a process that has a restrictive umask setting, normal file operations
  apply that restrictive mask. I have added code to apply appropriate
  permissions explicitly after a file copy or a directory creation.

  * chicken-setup: fix required-extension-version
  
  chicken-setup has a built-in command, required-chicken-extension, which takes a
  symbol and a string.  The symbol is the name of an extension, and the string is
  the minimum version number.  The command is supposed to terminate chicken-setup
  with an appropriate error message if the required extension is not already
  installed.
  
  This was broken so I fixed it.
