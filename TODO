TODO for macro/module system					-*- Outline -*-

* current module approach problems
** fixup of module export-list in ##sys#extend-macro-environment
   not done for static se's of global macros

* reimplement macros from chicken-more-macros hygienically

* test hygiene
* test macros expanding into macro calls
* test macros expanding into syntax-rules
* test local define{-values,-syntax,} expansion
* test extended lambda-lists
* test examples from r5rs spec
* test macro-expansions
** quoted literals
** qualified symbols
** extended lambda-list markers
** local definitions
* test line-number retention over macro-expansion

* test benchmarks

* reimplement chicken-more-macros hygienically

* remove define-macro and ##sys#lisp-transformer, once all macros are converted

* add low-level support for modules
* find suitable design for modules
** s48
** gauche

* update manual
** expand unit (move stuff from eval)
** document extensions
*** user defined ellipsis
** ack synrules authors
** removals
   define-macro
   define-record
   run-time and compile-time situations for eval-when

* csi
** describe should print if symbol is interned

* put mtest into "tests" directory and run on "make check"
** rename to "syntax-tests.scm"

* eggs to be adapted/obsoleted
** syntax-case (eval/expand integration?)
** codewalk
   must probably go... influences modules, crunch
** remove
   modules
** syntactic-closures?
** simple-macros
