TODO for macro/module system					-*- Outline -*-

* merge trunk into branch

* modules
** fixup of module export-list in ##sys#extend-macro-environment
*** not done for static se's of global macros (still relevant?)
*** current example (mtest) shows that imported a is not visible when using c
*** also, unexported ids used in exported syntax are not handled
** lookup before ##sys#rename-global in eval/canon. is suboptimal

* test extended lambda-lists
* test macro-expansions
** quoted literals
** qualified symbols
** extended lambda-list markers
** local definitions
* test line-number retention over macro-expansion

* test benchmarks

* add low-level support for modules
* find suitable design for modules

* update manual/NEWS
** expand unit (move stuff from eval)
** document extensions
*** user defined ellipsis
** ack synrules authors
** removals
   run-time and compile-time situations for eval-when
   define-foreign-record
   define-foreign-enum
   define-record
   define-macro

* csi
** describe should print if symbol is interned

* eggs to be adapted/obsoleted
** syntax-case (eval/expand integration?)
*** sxml-match
** codewalk
   must probably go... influences modules, crunch
** remove
   modules
** syntactic-closures?
** simple-macros
** alexpander
