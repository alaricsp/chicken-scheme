TODO for macro/module system					-*- Outline -*-

* bugs
** macro-aliases for bound vars
   if a macro-aliased id is used in binding form, later references to it still
   resolve to the original variable and so are resolved during canonicalization
   to the original, not the new binding.
   possible solution: update alias to a-converted new var?

* test hygiene
* test macros expanding into macro calls
* test macros expanding into syntax-rules
* test local define{-values,-syntax,} expansion
* test referential transparency
* test interaction of hygienic and non-hygienic macros
* test pattern matching macros
* test extended lambda-lists
* test examples from r5rs spec
* test macro-expansions
** quoted literals
** keywords
** qualified symbols
** extended lambda-list markers

* test r4rstest
* test benchmarks

* reimplement default macros hygienically
* reimplement chicken-more-macros hygienically

* integrate syntax-rules (synrules.scm)
** needs some form of syntax-quote?
** test macros expanding into syntax-rules with literals

* add low-level support for modules
* find suitable design for modules

* update manual
** expand unit (move stuff from eval, document extensions)

* csi
** describe should print if symbol is interned

* put mtest into "tests" directory and run on "make check"
