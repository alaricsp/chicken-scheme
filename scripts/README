README for scripts/
===================


This directory contains a couple of things that might be useful:

  scheme

    A wrapper sh(1) script that allows automatic compilation of Scheme
    scripts. If you precede a Scheme file with a header line like this

      #!/usr/bin/env scheme

    then a compiled version of the code will be stored in $HOME/.cache
    and executed, instead of the original source file.

  tools.scm

    Helper functions for some of the scripts here.

  test-dist.sh

    Takes a platform-designator and the path to a tarball and unpacks,
    builds and tests the chicken distribution contained therein.

  wiki2html.scm

    A simple svnwiki -> HTML translator used for the manual. Needs
    `htmlprag' and `matchable' eggs installed.

  make-egg-index.scm

    Creates an egg index HTML page from a local working copy of a
    `release/<number>' egg tree.

  makedist.scm

    Creates a distribution tarball from a chicken svn checkout.

  henrietta.scm
  henrietta.cgi

    A CGI script and sub-program that serves eggs from a local tree
    or via svn over HTTP.
