* Chicken Runtime Data Type Proposal *

Based on SRFI-99. I really like the SRFI-9 compatibility combined with the R6RS
features.


- Procedural Layer -

- Suggested canonical name form of a condition identifier is '&<condition
name>' where <condition name> is descriptive.

- Suggested canonical name form of an rtd identifier is ':<rtd name>'. I know
this conflicts with keyword-style; ':optional' redux.

- Procedural Layer per SRFI-99 with some extensions.

- Procedure rtd-constructor

(rtd-constructor RTD [FIELDSPECS [INIT ...]]) => CTOR

{{FIELDSPECS}} per SRFI-99.

{{INIT}} is an '<initial value>'

{{CTOR}} per SRFI-99, except when {{INIT}} specified, in which case the initial
value of the constructed rtd-object is supplied. Otherwise the field must named
in {{FIELDSPECS}}.

<initial value> -> initializer <field> <procedure/(-> object)>
                -> initial <field> <object>

- Procedure rtd-mutator

(rtd-mutator RTD FIELD [CHECKER]) => MUTATOR

{{CHECKER}} is a 'procedure' with signature '(object -> boolean)'.

{{MUTATOR}} per SRFI-99, except when a {{CHECKER}} specified. In which case the
mutating object is validated with the {{CHECKER}} before mutation and an
'&invalid-field-value' condition is raised if necessary.

- Procedure rtd-operator

(rtd-operator RTD OPERATION ...)

{{OPERATION}} is an '<operation>'.

<operation> -> printer <procedure/(rtd-object output-port)>
            -> displayer <procedure/(rtd-object output-port)>
            -> writer <procedure/(rtd-object output-port)>
            -> comparator <procedure/(rtd-object rtd-object -> (union -1 0 1))>
            -> hasher <procedure/(rtd-object (optional fixnum) -> fixnum)>

- Procedure rtd-operation

(rtd-operation RTD OPER) => PROCEDURE

{{OPER}} is an '<operation>'.

<operation> -> printer
            -> displayer
            -> writer
            -> comparator
            -> hasher

Default rtd operators can be generated when a user-supplied procedure is
unspecified.

- Can have routines like '(rtd-comparator RTD) => PROCEDURE'.

- make-rtd-parameter

(make-rtd-parameter RTD SETTER VALUE [GUARD]) => PARAMETER-PROCEDURE

{{SETTER}} is a 'procedure/(rtd-object object)'.

Returns a {{PARAMETER-PROCEDURE}} closed over the {{RTD}}.

'(make-parameter VALUE (lambda (x) (SETTER RTD (GUARD x))))'

- Procedure rtd-print-syntax

(rtd-print-syntax RTD [SYNTAX])
(rtd-print-syntax RTD) => '<print-syntax>'

{{SYNTAX}} is a '<print-syntax>'.

<print-syntax>  -> srfi-10
                -> character
                -> sharp
                -> parameterized
                -> none

'<print-syntax>' should probably be a keyword.

See - Discussion - below.

- Parameter current-print-syntax

(current-print-syntax [SYNTAX])
(current-print-syntax) => '<print-syntax>'

{{SYNTAX}} is a '<print-syntax>'.

Very unsure about this one.

- While SRFI-99 uses symbols to represent keyed arguments Chicken can use
keywords. The flag symbols of SRFI-99 would need to be represented as boolean
keyword arguments. Ex: 'opaque?' -> opaque?: #f/#t.

Both styles can be supported. However, an existing example of a keyword only
interpretation of a SRFI is "srfi-69.scm".

The symbol style is Scheme-y while the keyword style is CommonLisp-y. But I
like DSSSL lambda-lists so my preference is the keyword style, if only one must
be chosen.

Really think both should be supported when features are advertised as a SRFI
implementation. (Unit srfi-69 needs work.)


- Syntactic Layer -

- Macro define-record-type

(define-record-type TYPESPEC CTORSPEC PREDSPEC FLDSPEC ...)

{{TYPESPEC}} is a '<type spec>'.

{{CTORSPEC}} is a '<constructor spec>'.

{{PREDSPEC}} is a '<predicate spec>'.

{{FLDSPEC}} is a '<field spec>'.

<type spec>        -> <type name>
                   -> (<type name> <parent>)

                   -> (<field name> <accessor spec> <mutator spec> <check spec>)
                   -> (<field name> <accessor spec> <mutator spec> <check spec>)

                   -> #t            {default check procedure}
                   -> <expression>  {=> procedure/(object -> boolean)}

<parent>          -> #f           {no parent}
                  -> #t           {default parent}
                  -> <expression> {=> rtd-object}

<option>          -> sealed?
                  -> opaque?
                  -> uid <expression>         {=> symbol}
                  -> printer <expression>     {=> procedure/(rtd-object output-port)}
                  -> displayer <expression>   {=> procedure/(rtd-object output-port)}

- Procedure define-reader-ctor

(define-reader-ctor RTD () PROC)

Is this necessary, useful?

- Macro define-record-printer

(define-record-printer RTD (RTDVAR PORTVAR) EXPRESSION ...)

Does "(rtd-operator RTD 'printer (lambda (RTDVAR PORTVAR) EXPRESSION ...))"

Does "(rtd-operator RTD 'displayer PROC)"

- Macro define-record-writer

(define-record-hasher RTD () FUNC)

Does "(rtd-operator RTD 'hasher FUNC)"

- Macro define-record-operator

(define-record-operator RTD OPERATION ...)

Something like this possible but I don't see the point.


- Data Representation -

The core structure-type is a vector-like object with a reference to a
runtime-type-descriptor or rtd structure-type object in slot 0. So a
structure-type object always has at least 1 element.

For backwards compatibility a structure-type with a symbol in slot
0 can be given the current semantics. A synthetic rtd can be generated
on-the-fly for such cases.

- The rtd structure-type layout:

0	  Definition	  rtd
1	  Parent		    rtd or #f
2	  Name		      symbol
3	  Fields   	    vector-of (union symbol (symbol mutable) (symbol immutable))
4	  Sealed?		    boolean
5	  Opaque?		    boolean
6   Uid           symbol

- The "rtd" rtd structure-type object:

0	  self-reference
1	  #f
2   'rtd
3   #(parent name uid names kinds sealed opaque types inits)
4   #t
5   #t
6   #f

The Definition is not considered a "field" since it is always present.

The Uid violates the contract deliberately since user rtd's Uid must be a
symbol.

R6RS suggests an automatically generated Uid to be in the UUID namespace
prefixed with the rtd's Name. For example: 'rtd:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6'.

- Operations

-- The 'rtd-object' operations data-structure is a 'mapset' since it is
associative, unique-valued and extensible. Called the 'rtd-operation-mapset'.

-- Represention options:

1)  Use an associative data-structure keyed by 'rtd-object' returning
'rtd-operation-mapset' for that 'rtd-object'.

2) Store the 'rtd-operation-mapset' in the 'rtd-object'.

Both have their merits but the 1st option can coexist more easily with the
symbol-tag style. The '##sys#record-printers' would become
'##sys#record-operations'. Need routines to abstract the lookup of
'rtd-operation-mapset' so it can be generated automatically when not found.
Should also have finer-grained routines that return specific opration
procedures.

'##sys#record-operations' should probably be a hash-table since the current
a-list will be inefficient after some 'magic-limit' of about 12.

(The 'magic-limit' value is based on tests w/ Chicken 3 on my platfrom, YMMV.
This is the value used by "lookup-table" to switch between a-list & hash-table
representations.)

--- Extending utility of '##sys#hash-table'

The '##sys#hash-table' API currently only supports symbols. However, changing
the signature of the various '##sys#hash-table' routines to allow an optional
hash function is straight-forward. Affected are '##sys#hash-table-ref',
'##sys#hash-table-set!' and '##sys#hash-table-update!'. (The
'##sys#hash-table-location' routine doesn't need this change since only used
for environments.)


- Discussion -

-- The rtd-operations used by system routines:

'display'       '(rtd-displayer RTD)'

'write'         '(rtd-writer RTD)'

'equal?'        '(zero? ((rtd-comparator RTD) X Y))'

'equal?-hash'   '(rtd-hasher RTD)'

The 'rtd-printer' is used as a default for 'displayer' & 'writer', but will
not override.

-- Kinda think an 'rtd-object' should differentiate SRFI-10 syntax from other
forms:

The 'rtd-printer' could always produce SRFI-10 'read-syntax' while
'rtd-displayer' produces human-readable output & 'rtd-writer' uses the
'read-table'.

-- Identifiers

The identifiers are subject to the same rules as any other identifier in a
module. So the syntactic layer will "(define <type name> (make-rtd '<type name>
...))". So there is an identifier in the module namespace of '<type name>'.

But the Name rtd field is not in a module namespace! Any two rtd's w/ the same
Name but different Uid's are unique, no matter what the correspondence, if any,
between the fields. Any two rtd's w/ the same Uid must be eqv?/equal? in all
fields, except the Name can be different.

-- Slot access performance

Direct access to field slots by accessor & mutator procedures is tricky
w/Êinheritance. If the parent 'rtd-object' is available at expand time then the
syntactic layer can open code the slot index. Otherwise runtime fieldname ->
slot-index is needed. Kinda implies that an imported 'rtd-object' used as a
parent needs to be instantiated at compile time - how to determine an automatic
'-extend' is beyond me.

-- Unresolved:

--- Generative vs. Nongenerative

(Shiro Kawai comp.lang.scheme Sun, 8 Mar 2009 01:14:37 -0800 (PST) Generative/nongenerative record types)
This is just a rough idea from top of my head.  Feedbacks are welcome.

I've been feeling very uncomfortable about "nongenerative" record type
creation feature in R6RS but couldn't point my finger to what made me
feel so.  I see why the feature like that is needed, but it doesn't
look
like Scheme-way as I perceive (what Scheme-way is may vary widely
among people, though).  I dug the discussion about it and so far got
an impression that (1) first, make-record-type is understood to be
generative, in order to guarantee to create distinct types, and then
(2) uid for nongenerative record type creation is introduced, mainly
to accomodate efficient local record definitions.

Record type descriptor is an immutable object, and I tend to think
equality of immutable objects should, ideally, defined by equality of
its components (as Henry Baker suggests in [1]).  Implementation may
take advantage of immutability to share the same storage for
equivalent object.  Anyway, it seems weird that two immutalbe objects
are not equivalent even though I cannot distinguish one from the other
any way except the system-provided equivalence predicate (e.g. eqv?).

The only reason I can think of that immutable record types with
exactly the same definitions need to be distinguished is the necessity
of distinct types.

Then, how about separate type identity from structure definitions?

The record type in R6RS are burdened by two roles; creating distinct
types, and creating aggregate types.  These two are not the same;
sometimes I merely need an aggregate type for code readability and do
not care if it is distinct from other types.  I've been happily using
a macro that expands aggregate type definition into bunch of
procedures that operate on vectors.

Specifically,

* make-record-type-descriptor (or equivalent) is *allowed* to return
the
  identical rtd if all the given arguments are equivalent.

* Record type equivalence is based on equivalence of rtd's components.
(If the implementation returns identical rtd for equivalent arguments,
the comparison is effectively eq?).

* If you need distinct types, give make-record-type-descriptor
something
different.  An easiest way may be to add "type-id" component to rtd,
and
use eqv? to compare that component to determine equivalence of rtds.
It is easy to create distinct rtd by giving (cons #f #f) as type-id.

* For the syntactic layer, I'm not sure whether the define-record-type
macro should create a distinct type or not.  But I feel it better to
have different macros for distinct type creation and mere aggregate
type creation.  Local aggregate structure for readability requires
latter, while the record type which is part of external API of some
module may require former.

On the surface, this idea just reverses the default perception of
generative/nongenerative behavior of make-record-type-descriptor;
R6RS's is generative unless unique uid is given.  This one is
nongenerative unless unique type-id is given.  But this one eliminates
explicit bookkeeping of uids, which is effectively creating another
namespace in R6RS.
