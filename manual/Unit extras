== Unit extras

This unit contains a collection of useful utility definitions. 
This unit is used by default, unless the program
is compiled with the {{-explicit-use}} option.


=== Lists


==== alist-ref

 [procedure] (alist-ref KEY ALIST [TEST [DEFAULT]])

Looks up {{KEY}} in {{ALIST}} using {{TEST}} as the comparison function (or {{eqv?}} if
no test was given) and returns the cdr of the found pair, or {{DEFAULT}} (which defaults to {{#f}}).


==== alist-update!

 [procedure] (alist-update! KEY VALUE ALIST [TEST])

If the list {{ALIST}} contains a pair of the form {{(KEY . X)}}, then this procedure
replaces {{X}} with {{VALUE}} and returns {{ALIST}}. If {{ALIST}} contains no such item, then
{{alist-update!}} returns {{((KEY . VALUE) . ALIST)}}. The optional argument
{{TEST}} specifies the comparison procedure to search a matching pair in {{ALIST}}
and defaults to {{eqv?}}.


==== atom?

 [procedure] (atom? X)

Returns {{#t}} if {{X}} is not a pair. This is identical to {{not-pair?}} from [[Unit srfi-1]] but
kept for historical reasons.


==== rassoc

 [procedure] (rassoc KEY LIST [TEST])

Similar to {{assoc}}, but compares {{KEY}} with the {{cdr}} of each pair in {{LIST}} using
{{TEST}} as the comparison procedures (which defaults to {{eqv?}}.


==== butlast

 [procedure] (butlast LIST)

Returns a fresh list with all elements but the last of {{LIST}}.


==== chop

 [procedure] (chop LIST N)

Returns a new list of sublists, where each sublist contains {{N}}
elements of {{LIST}}. If {{LIST}} has a length that is not
a multiple of {{N}}, then the last sublist contains the remaining
elements.

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(chop '(1 2 3 4 5 6) 2) ==> ((1 2) (3 4) (5 6))
(chop '(a b c d) 3)     ==> ((a b c) (d))
</enscript>



==== compress

 [procedure] (compress BLIST LIST)

Returns a new list with elements taken from {{LIST}} with
corresponding true values in the list {{BLIST}}.

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(define nums '(99 100 110 401 1234))
(compress (map odd? nums) nums)      ==> (99 401)
</enscript>


==== flatten

 [procedure] (flatten LIST1 ...)

Returns {{LIST1 ...}} concatenated together, with nested lists
removed (flattened).


==== intersperse

 [procedure] (intersperse LIST X)

Returns a new list with {{X}} placed between each element.


==== join

 [procedure] (join LISTOFLISTS [LIST])

Concatenates the lists in {{LISTOFLISTS}} with {{LIST}} placed
between each sublist. {{LIST}} defaults to the empty list.

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(join '((a b) (c d) (e)) '(x y)) ==> (a b x y c d x y e)
(join '((p q) () (r (s) t)) '(-))  ==> (p q - - r (s) t)
</enscript>

{{join}} could be implemented as follows:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(define (join lstoflsts #!optional (lst '()))
  (apply append (intersperse lstoflists lst)) )
</enscript>


==== shuffle

 [procedure] (shuffle LIST)

Returns {{LIST}} with its elements sorted in a random order.


==== tail?

 [procedure] (tail? X LIST)

Returns true if {{X}} is one of the tails (cdr's) of {{LIST}}.



=== Formatted output


==== printf
==== fprintf
==== sprintf

 [procedure] (fprintf PORT FORMATSTRING ARG ...)
 [procedure] (printf FORMATSTRING ARG ...)
 [procedure] (sprintf FORMATSTRING ARG ...)

Simple formatted output to a given port ({{fprintf}}), the
value of {{(current-output-port)}} ({{printf}}), or a string
({{sprintf}}).  The {{FORMATSTRING}} can contain any sequence
of characters.  There must be at least as many {{ARG}} arguments given as there are format directives that require an argument in {{FORMATSTRING}}.  Extra {{ARG}} arguments are ignored.  The character `~' prefixes special formatting directives:

<table>
<tr><td> ~%
write newline character
</td></tr><tr><td> ~N
the same as {{~%}}
</td></tr><tr><td> ~S
write the next argument
</td></tr><tr><td> ~A
display the next argument
</td></tr><tr><td> ~\n
skip all whitespace in the format-string until the next non-whitespace character
</td></tr><tr><td> ~B
write the next argument as a binary number
</td></tr><tr><td> ~O
write the next argument as an octal number
</td></tr><tr><td> ~X
write the next argument as a hexadecimal number
</td></tr><tr><td> ~C
write the next argument as a character
</td></tr><tr><td> ~~
display `~'
</td></tr><tr><td> ~!
flush all pending output
</td></tr><tr><td> ~?
invoke formatted output routine recursively with the next two arguments as format-string and list of parameters
</td></tr></table>


==== format

 [procedure] (format [DESTINATION] FORMATSTRING ARG ...)

The parameters  {{FORMATSTRING}} and {{ARG ...}} are as for
({{printf}}/{{sprintf}}/{{fprintf}}).

The optional {{DESTINATION}}, when supplied, performs
a ({{sprintf}}) for a  {{#f}},
a ({{printf}}) for a {{#t}},
and a ({{fprintf}}) for an output-port.
When missing a ({{sprintf}}) is performed.



=== Hash tables

CHICKEN implements SRFI-69. For more information, 
see [[http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-69/srfi-69.html|SRFI-69]].

A setter for {{hash-table-ref}} is defined, so

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(set! (hash-table-ref HT KEY) VAL)
</enscript>

is equivalent to

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(hash-table-set! HT KEY VAL)
</enscript>

As an extension to SRFI-69, {{hash-table-update!}} and {{hash-table-update!/default}} return
the new value (after applying the update procedure).

==== hash-table-remove!

 [procedure] (hash-table-remove! HASHTABLE PROC)

Calls {{PROC}} for all entries in {{HASHTABLE}} with the key and value of each
entry. If {{PROC}} returns true, then that entry is removed.



=== Queues


==== list->queue

 [procedure] (list->queue LIST)

Returns {{LIST}} converted into a queue, where the first element
of the list is the same as the first element of the queue. The resulting
queue may share memory with the list and the list should not be modified
after this operation.


==== make-queue

 [procedure] (make-queue)

Returns a newly created queue.


==== queue?

 [procedure] (queue? X)

Returns {{#t}} if {{X}} is a queue, or {{#f}} otherwise.


==== queue->list

 [procedure] (queue->list QUEUE)

Returns {{QUEUE}} converted into a list, where the first element
of the list is the same as the first element of the queue. The resulting
list may share memory with the queue object and should not be modified.


==== queue-add!

 [procedure] (queue-add! QUEUE X)

Adds {{X}} to the rear of {{QUEUE}}.


==== queue-empty?

 [procedure] (queue-empty? QUEUE)

Returns {{#t}} if {{QUEUE}} is empty, or {{#f}} otherwise.


==== queue-first

 [procedure] (queue-first QUEUE)

Returns the first element of {{QUEUE}}. If {{QUEUE}} is empty
an error is signaled


==== queue-last

 [procedure] (queue-last QUEUE)

Returns the last element of {{QUEUE}}. If {{QUEUE}} is empty
an error is signaled


==== queue-remove!

 [procedure] (queue-remove! QUEUE)

Removes and returns the first element of {{QUEUE}}. If {{QUEUE}}
is empty an error is signaled


==== queue-push-back!

 [procedure] (queue-push-back! QUEUE ITEM)

Pushes an item into the first position of a queue, i.e. the next
{{queue-remove!}} will return {{ITEM}}.


==== queue-push-back-list!

 [procedure] (queue-push-back-list! QUEUE LIST)

Pushes the items in item-list back onto the queue,
so that {{(car LIST)}} becomes the next removable item.



=== Sorting


==== merge

 [procedure] (merge LIST1 LIST2 LESS?)
 [procedure] (merge! LIST1 LIST2 LESS?)

version of merge. {{LESS?  }} should be a procedure of two arguments,
that returns true if the first argument is to be ordered before the
second argument.


==== sort

 [procedure] (sort SEQUENCE LESS?)
 [procedure] (sort! SEQUENCE LESS?)

Sort {{SEQUENCE}}, which should be a list or a vector. {{sort!}}
is the destructive version of sort.

{{(current-seconds)}} if {{SEED}} is not given.


==== random

 [procedure] (random N)

Returns an exact random integer from 0 to {{N}}-1.


==== randomize

 [procedure] (randomize [X])

Set random-number seed. If {{X}} is not supplied, the current time is used.
On startup (when the {{extras}} unit is initialized), the random number generator
is initialized with the current time.


=== Input/Output extensions

==== pretty-print

 [procedure] (pretty-print EXP [PORT])
 [procedure] (pp EXP [PORT])

Print expression nicely formatted. {{PORT}} defaults to the value
of {{(current-output-port)}}.


==== pretty-print-width

read from the file or port {{FILE-OR-PORT}}. If no argument is given,
input is read from the port that is the current value of {{(current-input-port)}}.
After all expressions are read, and if the argument is a port, then the port will
not be closed. The {{READER}} argument specifies the procedure used to read 
expressions from the given file or port and defaults to {{read}}. The reader
procedure will be called with a single argument (an input port).
If {{MAXCOUNT}} is given then only up to {{MAXCOUNT}} expressions will be read in.


==== read-line
==== write-line

 [procedure] (read-line [PORT [LIMIT]])
 [procedure] (write-line STRING [PORT])

Line-input and -output. {{PORT}} defaults to the value of
{{(current-input-port)}} and {{(current-output-port)}},
respectively. If the optional argument {{LIMIT}} is given and
not {{#f}}, then {{read-line}} reads at most {{LIMIT}}
characters per line. {{read-line}} returns a string without the terminating newline and {{write-line}} adds a terminating newline  before outputting.


==== read-lines

 [procedure] (read-lines [PORT [MAX]])

Read {{MAX}} or fewer lines from {{PORT}}. {{PORT}}
defaults to the value of {{(current-input-port)}}. {{PORT}} may optionally be
a string naming a file. Returns a list of strings, each string representing a line read, not including any line separation character(s).


==== read-string
==== read-string!
==== write-string

 [procedure] (read-string [NUM [PORT]])
 [procedure] (read-string! NUM STRING [PORT [START]])
 [procedure] (write-string STRING [NUM [PORT]]

Read or write {{NUM}} characters from/to {{PORT}}, which defaults to the
value of {{(current-input-port)}} or {{(current-output-port)}}, respectively. 
If {{NUM}} is {{#f}} or not given, then all data
up to the end-of-file is read, or, in the case of {{write-string}} the whole
string is written. If no more input is available, {{read-string}} returns the
empty string. {{read-string!}} reads destructively into the given {{STRING}} argument,
but never more characters that would fit into {{STRING}}. If {{START}} is given, then
the read characters are stored starting at that position.
{{read-string!}} returns the actual number of characters read.


==== read-token

 [procedure] (read-token PREDICATE [PORT])

Reads characters from {{PORT}} (which defaults to the value of {{(current-input-port)}})
and calls the procedure {{PREDICATE}} with each character until {{PREDICATE}} returns
false. Returns a string with the accumulated characters.

</enscript>



==== string-chomp

 [procedure] (string-chomp STRING [SUFFIX])

If {{STRING}} ends with {{SUFFIX}}, then this procedure returns a copy of its first argument with the suffix
removed, otherwise returns {{STRING}} unchanged. {{SUFFIX}} defaults to {{"\n"}}.


==== string-compare3

 [procedure] (string-compare3 STRING1 STRING2)
 [procedure] (string-compare3-ci STRING1 STRING2)

Perform a three-way comparison between the {{STRING1}} and {{STRING2}},
returning either {{-1}} if {{STRING1}} is lexicographically less

{{string-compare3-ci}} performs a case-insensitive comparison.


==== string-intersperse

 [procedure] (string-intersperse LIST [STRING])

Returns a string that contains all strings in {{LIST}} concatenated
together.  {{STRING}} is placed between each concatenated string and
defaults to {{" "}}.

<enscript highlight=scheme>

(apply string-append (intersperse '("one" "two") "three"))
</enscript>


==== string-split

 [procedure] (string-split STRING [DELIMITER-STRING [KEEPEMPTY]])

Split string into substrings separated by the given delimiters. If
no delimiters are specified, a string comprising the tab, newline and space characters 
is assumed. If the
parameter {{KEEPEMPTY}} is given and not {{#f}}, then empty
substrings are retained:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(string-split "one  two  three") ==> ("one" "two" "three")
(string-split "foo:bar::baz:" ":" #t) ==> ("foo" "bar" "" "baz" "")
</enscript>


==== string-translate

 [procedure] (string-translate STRING FROM [TO])

Returns a fresh copy of {{STRING}} with characters matching
{{FROM}} translated to {{TO}}.  If {{TO}} is omitted, then
matching characters are removed. {{FROM}} and {{TO}} may be
a character, a string or a list. If both {{FROM}} and {{TO}}
are strings, then the character at the same position in {{TO}}
as the matching character in {{FROM}} is substituted.


==== string-translate*

 [procedure] (string-translate* STRING SMAP)

Substitutes elements of {{STRING}} according to {{SMAP}}.
{{SMAP}} should be an association-list where each element of the list
is a pair of the form {{(MATCH \. REPLACEMENT)}}. Every occurrence of
the string {{MATCH}} in {{STRING}} will be replaced by the string
{{REPLACEMENT}}:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(string-translate*
  "<h1>this is a \"string\"</h1>"
  '(("<" . "&lt;") (">" . "&gt;") ("\"" . "&quot;")) )
=>  "&lt;h1&gt;this is a &quot;string&quot;&lt;/h1&gt;"
</enscript>


==== substring=?

to 0), comparing {{LENGTH}} characters (which defaults to the minimum of the remaining
length of both strings).


==== substring-index

 [procedure] (substring-index WHICH WHERE [START])
 [procedure] (substring-index-ci WHICH WHERE [START])

Searches for first index in string {{WHERE}} where string
{{WHICH}} occurs.  If the optional argument {{START}} is given,
then the search starts at that index.  {{substring-index-ci}}
is a case-insensitive version of {{substring-index}}.
