== Unit expand

This unit has support for macro- and module handling. This unit is used
by default, unless the program is compiled with the {{-explicit-use}}
option.

=== Macros

==== get-line-number

 [procedure] (get-line-number EXPR)

If {{EXPR}} is a pair with the car being a symbol, and line-number
information is available for this expression, then this procedure returns
the associated line number. If line-number information is not available,
then {{#f}} is returned.  Note that line-number information for
expressions is only available in the compiler.

==== macro?

 [procedure] (macro? SYMBOL)

Returns {{#t}} if there exists a macro-definition for {{SYMBOL}}.

==== expand

 [procedure] (expand X)

If {{X}} is a macro-form, expand the macro (and repeat expansion
until expression is a non-macro form).  Returns the resulting expression.

==== undefine-macro!

 [procedure] (undefine-macro! SYMBOL)

Remove the current macro-definition of the macro named {{SYMBOL}}.

==== syntax-error

 [procedure] (syntax-error [LOCATION] MESSAGE ARGUMENT ...)

Signals an exception of the kind {{(exn syntax)}}. Otherwise identical to 
{{error}}.
