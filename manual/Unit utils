== Unit utils

This unit contains a "grab bag" of procedures without a good home, and which
don't have to be available by default (as compared to the [[Unit
extras|extras]] unit).

This unit uses the {{extras}} and {{srfi-13}} units.


=== Executing shell commands with formatstring and error checking

==== system*

 [procedure] (system* FORMATSTRING ARGUMENT1 ...)

Similar to {{(system (sprintf FORMATSTRING ARGUMENT1 ...))}},
but signals an error if the invoked program should return a nonzero
exit status.

=== Iterating over input lines and files

==== for-each-line

 [procedure] (for-each-line PROCEDURE [PORT])

Calls {{PROCEDURE}} for each line read from {{PORT}} (which defaults to the
value of {{(current-input-port)}}. The argument passed to {{PROCEDURE}}
is a string with the contents of the line, excluding any line-terminators.
When all input has been read from the port, {{for-each-line}} returns some unspecified value.

==== for-each-argv-line

 [procedure] (for-each-argv-line PROCEDURE)

Opens each file listed on the command line in order, passing one line
at a time into {{PROCEDURE}}.  The filename {{-}} is interpreted as
{{(current-input-port)}}.  If no arguments are given on the command line
it again uses the value of {{(current-input-port)}}. During execution of
{{PROCEDURE}}, the current input port will be correctly bound to
the current input source.

This code will act as a simple Unix cat(1) command:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(for-each-argv-line print)
</enscript>


=== Reading a file's contents

==== read-all

 [procedure] (read-all [FILE-OR-PORT])

If {{FILE-OR-PORT}} is a string, then this procedure returns the contents of the file
as a string. If {{FILE-OR-PORT}} is a port, all remaining input is read and returned as
a string. The port is not closed. If no argument is provided, input will be read from the
port that is the current value of {{(current-input-port)}}.


=== Shell argument quoting

==== qs

 [procedure] (qs STRING [PLATFORM])

Escapes {{STRING}} suitably for passing to a shell command on {{PLATFORM}}.
{{PLATFORM}} defaults to the value of {{(build-platform)}} and indicates in
which style the argument should be quoted. On Windows systems, the string
is simply enclosed in double-quote ({{"}}) characters, on UNIXish systems,
characters that would have a special meaning to the shell are escaped
using backslash ({{\}}).


=== Dynamic compilation

==== compile-file

 [procedure] (compile-file FILENAME #!key options output-file)

Compiles the Scheme source file {{FILENAME}} into a dynamically
loadable library by invoking the {{csc}} compiler driver. If the
library can be successfully created, it is loaded into the current
Scheme process. {{options}} may be a list of strings which are passed
as additional command line options to {{csc}}. If {{output-file}} is
not given, then the compiled file is stored in a temporary location
and will be deleted when the process exits successfully.
When compilation and loading succeeds, the name of the compiled file
is returned.

Notes:

* loading the same compiled file multiple times is only supported on Linux
  in the moment and should be considered unreliable. For this reason, a new temporary
  file is created for every invocation of {{compile-file}}, unless an explicit
  output file name is given.

* this procedure is compatible to the {{scheme-compile-file}} command in {{emacs}}' {{scheme-mode}}.

==== compile-file-options

 [parameter] compile-file-options

A parameter that holds a list of default options that should be given
to {{csc}} after invocation of the {{compile-file}} procedure. 
The initial default options are {{-scrutinize -O2 -d2}}.
