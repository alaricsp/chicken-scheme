== Unit utils

This unit contains apropos and functions as a "grab bag" of procedures
without a good home, and which don't have to be available by default
(as compared to the [[Unit extras|extras]] unit).

This unit uses the {{extras}} and {{regex}} units.


=== Environment Query

==== apropos

 [procedure] (apropos SYMBOL-PATTERN [ENVIRONMENT] [#:MACROS?])

Displays symbols & type matching {{SYMBOL-PATTERN}} in the {{ENVIRONMENT}} on the {{(current-output-port)}}.

; {{SYMBOL-PATTERN}} : A symbol, string, or regex. When symbol or string substring matching is performed.
; {{ENVIRONMENT}} : An environment. When missing the {{(interaction-environment)}} is assumed.
; {{#:MACROS?}} : Keyword argument. A boolean. Include macro symbols? When missing {{#f}} is assumed.

==== apropos-list

 [procedure] (apropos-list SYMBOL-PATTERN [ENVIRONMENT] [#:MACROS?])

Like {{apropos}} but returns a list of matching symbols.


=== Iterating over input lines and files

==== for-each-line

 [procedure] (for-each-line PROCEDURE [PORT])

Calls {{PROCEDURE}} for each line read from {{PORT}} (which defaults to the
value of {{(current-input-port)}}. The argument passed to {{PROCEDURE}}
is a string with the contents of the line, excluding any line-terminators.
When all input has been read from the port, {{for-each-line}} returns some unspecified value.

==== for-each-argv-line

 [procedure] (for-each-argv-line PROCEDURE)

Opens each file listed on the command line in order, passing one line
at a time into {{PROCEDURE}}.  The filename {{-}} is interpreted as
{{(current-input-port)}}.  If no arguments are given on the command line
it again uses the value of {{(current-input-port)}}. During execution of
{{PROCEDURE}}, the current input port will be correctly bound to
the current input source.

This code will act as a simple Unix cat(1) command:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(for-each-argv-line print)
</enscript>

=== Executing shell commands with formatstring and error checking

==== system*

 [procedure] (system* FORMATSTRING ARGUMENT1 ...)

Similar to {{(system (sprintf FORMATSTRING ARGUMENT1 ...))}},
but signals an error if the invoked program should return a nonzero
exit status.


=== Reading a file's contents

==== read-all

 [procedure] (read-all [FILE-OR-PORT])

If {{FILE-OR-PORT}} is a string, then this procedure returns the contents of the file
as a string. If {{FILE-OR-PORT}} is a port, all remaining input is read and returned as
a string. The port is not closed. If no argument is provided, input will be read from the
port that is the current value of {{(current-input-port)}}.
