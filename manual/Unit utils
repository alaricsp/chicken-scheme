== Unit utils

This unit contains file/pathname oriented procedures, apropos, plus acts as a "grab bag" for procedures without a good home,
and which don't have to be available by default (as compared to the [[Unit extras|extras]] unit).

This unit uses the {{extras}} and {{regex}} units.


=== Environment Query

==== apropos

 [procedure] (apropos SYMBOL-PATTERN [ENVIRONMENT] [#:MACROS?])

Displays symbols & type matching {{SYMBOL-PATTERN}} in the {{ENVIRONMENT}} on the {{(current-output-port)}}.

; {{SYMBOL-PATTERN}} : A symbol, string, or regex. When symbol or string substring matching is performed.
; {{ENVIRONMENT}} : An environment. When missing the {{(interaction-environment)}} is assumed.
; {{#:MACROS?}} : Keyword argument. A boolean. Include macro symbols? When missing {{#f}} is assumed.

==== apropos-list

 [procedure] (apropos-list SYMBOL-PATTERN [ENVIRONMENT] [#:MACROS?])

Like {{apropos}} but returns a list of matching symbols.


=== Pathname operations

==== absolute-pathname?

 [procedure] (absolute-pathname? PATHNAME)

Returns {{#t}} if the string {{PATHNAME}} names an absolute
pathname, and returns {{#f}} otherwise.

==== decompose-pathname

 [procedure] (decompose-pathname PATHNAME)

Returns three values: the directory-, filename- and extension-components
of the file named by the string {{PATHNAME}}.
For any component that is not contained in {{PATHNAME}}, {{#f}} is returned.

==== make-pathname
==== make-absolute-pathname

 [procedure] (make-pathname DIRECTORY FILENAME [EXTENSION [SEPARATOR]])
 [procedure] (make-absolute-pathname DIRECTORY FILENAME [EXTENSION [SEPARATOR]])

Returns a string that names the file with the
components {{DIRECTORY, FILENAME}} and (optionally)
{{EXTENSION}} with {{SEPARATOR}} being the directory separation indicator
(usually {{/}} on UNIX systems and {{\}} on Windows, defaulting to whatever
platform this is running on). 
{{DIRECTORY}} can be {{#f}} (meaning no
directory component), a string or a list of strings. {{FILENAME}}
and {{EXTENSION}} should be strings or {{#f}}.
{{make-absolute-pathname}} returns always an absolute pathname.

==== pathname-directory

 [procedure] (pathname-directory PATHNAME)

==== pathname-file

 [procedure] (pathname-file PATHNAME)

==== pathname-extension

 [procedure] (pathname-extension PATHNAME)

Accessors for the components of {{PATHNAME}}. If the pathname does
not contain the accessed component, then {{#f}} is returned.

==== pathname-replace-directory

 [procedure] (pathname-replace-directory PATHNAME DIRECTORY)

==== pathname-replace-file

 [procedure] (pathname-replace-file PATHNAME FILENAME)

==== pathname-replace-extension

 [procedure] (pathname-replace-extension PATHNAME EXTENSION)

Return a new pathname with the specified component of {{PATHNAME}}
replaced by a new value.

==== pathname-strip-directory

 [procedure] (pathname-strip-directory PATHNAME)

==== pathname-strip-extension

 [procedure] (pathname-strip-extension PATHNAME)

Return a new pathname with the specified component of {{PATHNAME}}
stripped.

==== directory-null?

 [procedure] (directory-null? DIRECTORY)

Does the {{DIRECTORY}} consist only of path separators and the period?

{{DIRECTORY}} may be a string or a list of strings.


=== Temporary files

==== create-temporary-file

 [procedure] (create-temporary-file [EXTENSION])

Creates an empty temporary file and returns its pathname. If
{{EXTENSION}} is not given, then {{.tmp}} is used. If the
environment variable {{TMPDIR, TEMP}} or {{TMP}} is set,
then the pathname names a file in that directory.


=== Deleting a file without signalling an error

==== delete-file*

 [procedure] (delete-file* FILENAME)

If the file {{FILENAME}} exists, it is deleted and {{#t}}
is returned.  If the file does not exist, nothing happens and {{#f}}
is returned.


=== File move/copy

==== file-copy

 [procedure] (file-copy ORIGFILE NEWFILE #!optional CLOBBER BLOCKSIZE)

Copies {{ORIGFILE}} (a string denoting some filename) to {{NEWFILE}}, 
{{BLOCKSIZE}} bytes at a time.  {{BLOCKSIZE}} defaults to 1024, and must be
a positive integer.  Returns the number of bytes copied on success, or errors
on failure.  {{CLOBBER}} determines the behaviour of {{file-copy}} when
{{NEWFILE}} is already extant.  When set to {{#f}} (default), an error is
signalled.  When set to any other value, {{NEWFILE}} is overwritten.
{{file-copy}} will work across filesystems and devices and is not
platform-dependent.

==== file-move

 [procedure] (file-move ORIGFILE NEWFILE #!optional CLOBBER BLOCKSIZE)

Moves {{ORIGFILE}} (a string denoting some filename) to {{NEWFILE}}, with
the same semantics as {{file-copy}}, above.  {{file-move}} is safe across
filesystems and devices (unlike {{file-rename}}).  It is possible for an
error to be signalled despite partial success if {{NEWFILE}} could be created
and fully written but removing {{ORIGFILE}} fails.


=== Iterating over input lines and files

==== for-each-line

 [procedure] (for-each-line PROCEDURE [PORT])

Calls {{PROCEDURE}} for each line read from {{PORT}} (which defaults to the
value of {{(current-input-port)}}. The argument passed to {{PROCEDURE}}
is a string with the contents of the line, excluding any line-terminators.
When all input has been read from the port, {{for-each-line}} returns some unspecified value.

==== for-each-argv-line

 [procedure] (for-each-argv-line PROCEDURE)

Opens each file listed on the command line in order, passing one line
at a time into {{PROCEDURE}}.  The filename {{-}} is interpreted as
{{(current-input-port)}}.  If no arguments are given on the command line
it again uses the value of {{(current-input-port)}}. During execution of
{{PROCEDURE}}, the current input port will be correctly bound to
the current input source.

This code will act as a simple Unix cat(1) command:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(for-each-argv-line print)
</enscript>

=== Executing shell commands with formatstring and error checking

==== system*

 [procedure] (system* FORMATSTRING ARGUMENT1 ...)

Similar to {{(system (sprintf FORMATSTRING ARGUMENT1 ...))}},
but signals an error if the invoked program should return a nonzero
exit status.


=== Reading a file's contents

==== read-all

 [procedure] (read-all [FILE-OR-PORT])

If {{FILE-OR-PORT}} is a string, then this procedure returns the contents of the file
as a string. If {{FILE-OR-PORT}} is a port, all remaining input is read and returned as
a string. The port is not closed. If no argument is provided, input will be read from the
port that is the current value of {{(current-input-port)}}.
