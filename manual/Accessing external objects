== Accessing external objects

=== foreign-code

 [syntax] (foreign-code STRING ...)

Executes the embedded C/C++ code {{STRING ...}}, which should
be a sequence of C statements, which are executed and return an unspecified result.

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(foreign-code "doSomeInitStuff();")     =>  #<unspecified>
</enscript>

Code wrapped inside {{foreign-code}} may not invoke callbacks into Scheme.


=== foreign-value

 [syntax] (foreign-value CODE TYPE)

Evaluates the embedded C/C++ expression {{CODE}} (which may be a string or symbol), returning a value of type given
in the foreign-type specifier {{TYPE}}.

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(print (foreign-value "my_version_string" c-string))
</enscript>


=== foreign-declare

 [syntax] (foreign-declare STRING ...)

Include given strings verbatim into header of generated file.


=== define-foreign-type

 [syntax] (define-foreign-type NAME TYPE [ARGCONVERT [RETCONVERT]])

Defines an alias for {{TYPE}} with the name {{NAME}} (a symbol).
{{TYPE}} may be a type-specifier or a string naming a C type. The
namespace of foreign type specifiers is separate from the normal
Scheme namespace.  The optional arguments {{ARGCONVERT}} and
{{RETCONVERT}} should evaluate to procedures that map argument- and
result-values to a value that can be transformed to {{TYPE}}:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(define-foreign-type char-vector 
  nonnull-c-string
  (compose list->string vector->list)
  (compose list->vector string->list) )

(define strlen
  (foreign-lambda int "strlen" char-vector) )

(strlen '#(#\a #\b #\c))                      ==> 3

(define memset
  (foreign-lambda char-vector "memset" char-vector char int) )

(memset '#(#_ #_ #_) #\X 3)                ==> #(#\X #\X #\X)
</enscript>

Foreign type-definitions are only visible in the compilation-unit in which
they are defined, so use {{include}} to use the same definitions
in multiple files.


=== define-foreign-variable

 [syntax] (define-foreign-variable NAME TYPE [STRING])

Defines a foreign variable of name {{NAME}} (a symbol). {{STRING}}
should be the real name of a foreign variable or parameterless
macro. If {{STRING}} is not given, then the variable name {{NAME}}
will be converted to a string and used instead. All references and
assignments (via {{set!}}) are modified to correctly convert values
between Scheme and C representation. This foreign variable can only be
accessed in the current compilation unit, but the name can be
lexically shadowed.  Note that {{STRING}} can name an arbitrary C
expression. If no assignments are performed, then {{STRING}} doesn't
even have to specify an lvalue.


=== foreign-lambda

 [syntax] (foreign-lambda RETURNTYPE NAME ARGTYPE ...)

Represents a
binding to an external routine. This form can be used in the position
of an ordinary {{lambda}} expression. {{NAME}} specifies the
name of the external procedure and should be a string or a symbol.


=== foreign-lambda*

 [syntax] (foreign-lambda* RETURNTYPE ((ARGTYPE VARIABLE) ...) STRING ...)

Similar to {{foreign-lambda}}, but instead of generating code to
call an external function, the body of the C procedure is directly given
in {{STRING ...}}:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(define my-strlen
  (foreign-lambda* int ((c-string str))
    "int n = 0;
     while(*(str++)) ++n;
     C_return(n);") )

(my-strlen "one two three")             ==> 13
</enscript>

For obscure technical reasons you should use the {{C_return}} macro instead of the normal {{return}} statement
to return a result from the foreign lambda body as some cleanup code has to be run before execution
commences in the calling code.

=== foreign-safe-lambda

 [syntax] (foreign-safe-lambda RETURNTYPE NAME ARGTYPE ...)

This is similar to {{foreign-lambda}}, but also allows the called
function to call Scheme functions and allocate Scheme data-objects. See [[Callbacks]].


=== foreign-safe-lambda*

 [syntax] (foreign-safe-lambda* RETURNTYPE ((ARGTYPE VARIABLE)...) STRING ...)

This is similar to {{foreign-lambda*}}, but also allows the called
function to call Scheme functions and allocate Scheme data-objects. See [[Callbacks]].



=== foreign-primitive

 [syntax] (foreign-primitive [RETURNTYPE] ((ARGTYPE VARIABLE) ...) STRING ...)

This is also similar to {{foreign-lambda*}} but the code will be executed
in a ''primitive'' CPS context, which means it will not actually return, but
call it's continuation on exit. This means that code inside this form may
allocate Scheme data on the C stack (the ''nursery'') with {{C_alloc}}
(see below). If the {{RETURNTYPE}} is omitted it defaults to {{void}}.
You can return multiple values inside the body of the {{foreign-primitive}}
form by calling this C function:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
C_values(N + 2, C_SCHEME_UNDEFINED, C_k, X1, ...)
</enscript>

where {{N}} is the number of values to be returned, and {{X1, ...}} are the
results, which should be Scheme data objects. When returning multiple values, the
return-type should be omitted.
