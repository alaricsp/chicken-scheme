== Locations

It is also possible to define variables containing unboxed C data,
so called ''locations''. It should be noted that locations may
only contain simple data, that is: everything that fits into a
machine word, and double-precision floating point values. 



=== define-location

 [syntax] (define-location NAME TYPE [INIT])

Identical to {{(define-external NAME TYPE [INIT])}}, but the variable
is not accessible from outside of the current compilation unit (it is 
declared {{static}}).

=== let-location

 [syntax] (let-location ((NAME TYPE [INIT]) ...) BODY ...)

Defines a lexically bound location.

=== location

 [syntax] (location NAME)
 [syntax] (location X)

This form returns a pointer object
that contains the address of the variable {{NAME}}. 
If the argument to {{location}} is not a location defined by {{define-location}},
{{define-external}} or {{let-location}}, then

 (location X)

is essentially equivalent to 

 (make-locative X)

(See the manual chapter or {{locatives}} for more information about
locatives.

Note that {{(location X)}} may be abbreviated as {{#$X}}.

<enscript highlight=scheme>
(define-external foo int)
((foreign-lambda* void (((c-pointer int) ip)) "*ip = 123;") 
  (location foo))
foo                                                                               ==> 123
</enscript>

This facility is especially useful in situations, where a C function
returns more than one result value:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
#>
#include <math.h>
<#

(define modf
  (foreign-lambda double "modf" double (c-pointer double)) )

(let-location ([i double])
  (let ([f (modf 1.99 (location i))])
    (print "i=" i ", f=" f) ) )
</enscript>

See [[http://chicken.wiki.br/location-and-c-string-star|location and c-string*]] 
for a tip on returning a {{c-string*}} type.

{{location}} returns a value of type {{c-pointer}}, when given
the name of a callback-procedure defined with {{define-external}}.
