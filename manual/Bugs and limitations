== Bugs and limitations

* Compiling large files takes too much time.

* If a known procedure has unused arguments, but is always called without those parameters, then the optimizer ''repairs'' the procedure in certain situations and removes the parameter from the lambda-list.

* {{port-position}} currently works only for input ports.

* Leaf routine optimization can theoretically result in code that thrashes, if tight loops perform excessively many mutations.
