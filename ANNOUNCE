ANN.: CHICKEN 4.0.0

Version 4.0.0 of CHICKEN, the portable and practical Scheme system has
been released. In addition to many bugfixes and cleaning up, it provides
the following significant changes:

- PCRE has been replaced by Alex Shinn's excellent "IrRegex" regular
  expression package (while still being API compatible to the old
  regular expression subsystem)

- New implementations of tools to download, build and install extension
  libraries, which are easier to use and provide more flexibility

- The macro system has been completely rewritten and is now fully
  hygienic with highlevel R5RS "syntax-rules" macros and low level
  "explicit renaming" macros that allow full control over hygienie;
  "define-macro" is not available anymore

- A module system has been implemented that fully supports hygienic
  macros and still integrates with separate and cross compilation

- Experimental support for cross-module inlining
