The CHICKEN Scheme-to-C compiler, Version 2.6 is now
available at <http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org>.

Things changed since the last release (2.5):

- Many bugfixes
- Better support for Sun's C compiler
- Input-performance has been improved
- PCRE (Perl compatible regular expressions) by Philip Hazel is now
  bundled with CHICKEN
- Static linking of extensions is now possible (when supported by
  the egg)
- The interpreter warns about references to potentially unbound variables
  in loaded code and expressions entered on the REPL
- The expansion process is traced during compilation and interpretation
  to give (slightly) more usable syntactic context in error messages
- library:
  * added `any?`, `bit-set?' and `on-exit'
- eval:
  * new procedure `set-parameterized-read-syntax!'
- posix: 
  * SRFI-17 setters for `file-position`, `current-user-id', 
    `current-group-id', `process-group-id'; the respective setter-procedures
    are still available but have been deprecated
  * `file-stat' returns more information (including device info)
  * added `process*'
- extras:
  * added `read-string!'
- utils:
  * `apropos' and `apropos-list' procedures
- srfi-4:
  * added `read-u8vector', `read-u8vector!' and `write-u8vector'
- srfi-18:  
  * added `time->milliseconds' and `milliseconds->time'
- csi:
  * `-ss SCRIPTNAME' option
- csc:
  * accepts options given in the environment variable `CSC_OPTIONS'
  * new options `-static-extensions' and `-host'
- chicken/csc:
  * new option `-keep-shadowed-macros'
- chicken-setup:
  * accepts options given in the environment variable `CHICKEN_SETUP_OPTIONS'
  * allows retrieval and installation of eggs from subversion repository
    and the local filesystem
  * new options `-tree FILENAME', `-svn', `-local', `-revision' and 
    `-destdir PATHNAME'
  * added helper procedures `required-chicken-version' and
    `required-extension-version'
- Lots of improvements in the CMake build

Thanks again to Brandon Van Every for his extensive work on the CMake

Special thanks to Kon Lovett for many improvements made in the posix
library.


Features:

- Generates tail-recursive C with full support for first-class 
  continuations and multiple values (Using the translation
  scheme as described in Henry Baker's paper "Cheney on the M.T.A.").
- Fairly R5RS compliant.
- Support for SRFIs 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 
  23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 43, 45, 47, 55, 57, 60, 
  61, 62, 63, 66, 69, 72 and 78.
- Record structures, hash-tables, queues, custom I/O ports, extended string
  operations, regular expressions, TCP sockets and more...
- Provides an object system with multiple inheritance, multimethods and a 
  Meta-Object-Protocol (based on Gregor Kiczales' TinyCLOS).
- Lightweight threads (based on call/cc).
- High portability (known to work on Windows, Linux, Free/Net/Open BSD,
  Solaris, SunOS, MAC OS X, HP-UX, IRIX and probably many more. Supported
  processors include x86, AMD64, Sparc, PA-RISC, Alpha, ARM, IA64, S/390, MIPS
  and PowerPC).
- Freely available under the BSD license.
- A POSIX interface (partially available for Windows)
- Powerful pattern matching macros.
- `syntax-case' macros and module system
- Generation of profiling information.
- A extensive Foreign Function Interface with callbacks, finalization,
  user defined foreign type converters, locatives, embedding of C code inside 
  Scheme programs, statically allocated (non GC'd) Scheme data and the 
  possibility of embedding compiled Scheme code into other applications.
- On many systems compiled code can be loaded dynamically into a running
  application.
- Uses a simple static linking system that allows easy creation of self-
  contained executables.
- The compiler can be customized in various ways.
- Support for writing interpreted or compiled UNIX shell scripts or 
  Windows batch files.
- A separate utility allows straightforward download, build and installation
  of extension libraries.


Limitations:

- No unlimited-precision integers (bignums), rationals or complex numbers
  (available seperately as an extension)
- No support for unicode (also available separately)
- Procedures can not have more than 126 arguments (more on certain platforms or
  when libffi is available).
- Compilation of large files is quite slow.

The current development version can be accessed through the "darcs"
revision control system (available at <http://www.darcs.net>), like
this:

  $ darcs get http://galinha.ucpel.tche.br/chicken

If you prefer subversion (<http://subversion.tigris.org>) access, get
it like this:

  $ svn co https://galinha.ucpel.tche.br/svn/chicken-eggs/chicken

(Username is "anonymous", enter <RETURN> when asked for a password)

See the file README.darcs for details on how to bootstrap the system.

Catolica de Pelotas for providing the server that hosts the source
repository!
